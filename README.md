# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component

## Overview

Welcome to my solution for the Frontend Mentor challenge!

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data for the results in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to add the results and total score dynamically if you choose.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## Technics that I used:

- Semantic HTML5 markup.
- CSS custom properties.
- Flexbox.

## Solution Overview:

For this challenge, I built a results summary component that displays user results in a clean and organized format. The HTML structure establishes the layout, while CSS is used for styling to match the provided design mockups. Flexbox plays a key role in creating a responsive and adaptable layout, aligning items efficiently and ensuring a consistent appearance across different screen sizes. Additionally, linear gradients are applied to enhance the visual design, with careful attention to
gradient direction to achieve the desired aesthetic effect.

## What I Learned ?

I learned about several features of Flexbox that facilitate precise element positioning, as well as how to use linear gradients and control their direction.
